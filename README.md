# speedy javascript compiler

javascript compiler that produces code faster than you can finish

## Environment setup

Before running the project, you will need to set up some sort of virtual environment
for yourself to install the dependencies in.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

if you're new to virtual environments, i'm too lazy
to repeat what has already been written somewhere else [so i'll link to that instead](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

## Developer instructions

Once you've set up an environment properly, you'll need to install all the
dependencies.

```shell
# make sure you're in the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run sjc as a developer, you don't need to build anything. Simply execute

```shell
python -m sjc
```

and you're off to the races ðŸš€
